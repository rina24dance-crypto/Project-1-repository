<h1>My story from America</h1>
<p>Today I want to tell you a story when I was in America in 2023. It was in the airport of DC when I was having my first flight there.
I was really tired and just wanted to rest that night but I missed the DC flight to Chicago because of a delay so I decided to find a hotel nearby.</p>
<p>But it was hard to do. I didn't even know how to call a cab. I didn't have the internet and the right charger for my phone.<br>So I went downstairs to find the taxi in the airport and I did it despite being feared and exhausted.</p><p>Then one of the <b>SCARIEST MOMENTS</b> took place. I got to the hotel but then had to <i>return to the airport by step.</i> </p>
it's a long story actually but I want to put stress on the fact that <mark>YOU GOTTA STAY INSIDE AT NIGHT IF YOU JUST ARRIVED AT THE PLACE YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN TO.</mark> </p>
<p>I ended up well but what I went through is gonna stay with me forever.</p>
